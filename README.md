Magnus Game Engine

WIP personal project attempting to implement a graphics-API and platform agnostic game engine in Rust.

Primary goals are:
1. Achieve compatibility with all major graphics APIs (DirectX 11,12; OpenGL; Vulkan; Metal), with initial focus on OpenGL.
2. Achieve compatibility with all major PC platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux)
3. Achieve a high level of performance without sacrificing ergonomics or safety
